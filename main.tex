\section*{The Heart of Collaboration on GitHub}
Next we demystify the process of "forking" on GitHub, guiding you step-by-step on how to take MSMiB and create a version uniquely yours.

\subsection*{Understanding Forking}
Before diving into the specifics, it's crucial to understand what "forking" means in the context of GitHub. In the simplest terms, to "fork" a project means to create a personal copy of someone else's project. Forking allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forking is akin to taking a book you admire and making a copy to write your notes, edits, or additional chapters without altering the original book.

\subsection*{Why Fork?}
\subsubsection*{Experimentation}
It provides a safe space where you can test out ideas, make changes, or introduce new content.

\subsubsection*{Personalization}
For projects like MSMiB, it allows readers to customize the content, tailor it to their perspectives, or even localize it for specific audiences.

\subsubsection*{Collaboration}
If you believe your changes have broad appeal, you can propose that they be incorporated back into the original project, enriching it with your unique contributions.

\subsection*{Step-by-Step Forking Guide}
\subsubsection*{Set Up Your GitHub Account}
If you don't have an account on GitHub, you'll need to create one. Visit GitHub's official site and sign up.

\subsubsection*{Navigate to the MSMiB Repository}
Once logged in, search for the MSMiB project or navigate to its URL directly.

\subsubsection*{Click the 'Fork' Button}
The fork button is located at the top right corner of the repository page; this button will create a copy of MSMiB in your account.

\subsubsection*{Clone Your Forked Repository}
Forking allows you to have a local copy on your computer, making editing and experimentation easier. Use the command: \texttt{git clone [URL of your forked repo]}.

\subsubsection*{Make Your Changes}
Using your preferred tools, introduce the edits, additions, or modifications you desire.

\subsubsection*{Commit and Push Changes}
Once satisfied, save these changes (known as a "commit") and then "push" them to your forked repository on GitHub.

\subsubsection*{Optional – Create a Pull Request}
If you believe your changes should be incorporated into the original MSMiB repository, you can create a "pull request." A pull request notifies the original authors of your suggestions.

\subsection*{Things to Keep in Mind}
\subsubsection*{Stay Updated}
The original MSMiB project may undergo updates. It's a good practice to regularly "pull" from the original repo to keep your fork up-to-date.

\subsubsection*{Engage with the Community}
Open-source thrives on community interactions. Engage in discussions, seek feedback, and please remain open to constructive criticism.

\subsection*{Conclusion: Embracing the Forking Culture}
Forking is more than just a technical process; it symbolizes the ethos of open-source — a world where knowledge is not hoarded but shared, refined, and built upon collectively. By forking MSMiB or any other project, you're not just creating a personal copy; you're becoming a part of a global movement that values collaboration, innovation, and the shared pursuit of knowledge.

% Discusses numeration systems, place value, zero, and number magnitude.
\subsection{Structure of Numeration Systems}
% Explanation of various numeration systems used historically and in different cultures.
This subsection explores the development and structure of different numeration systems, including the Roman numeral system, the Egyptian hieroglyphic system, and the currently prevalent Hindu-Arabic numeral system. Students will learn how different civilizations conceptualized and represented numbers.


\textbf{Example:} Compare the representation of the number fifty in Roman numerals (L) and Hindu-Arabic numerals (50), highlighting the differences in structure and ease of use in calculations.


\subsection{Roles of Place Value and Zero}
% Exploration of the concept of place value and the critical role of zero in modern numeration.
Place value is a fundamental concept in our number system, where the value of a digit depends on its position. This subsection emphasizes the importance of place value in performing arithmetic operations efficiently. The introduction of zero as a number and its role as a placeholder in the place value system is also discussed, illustrating its significance in modern mathematics.


\textbf{Example:} Demonstrate how the number 205 differs from 250 by changing the position of 0, showing the importance of place value. Additionally, explain how the introduction of zero transformed the way we perform arithmetic operations.

\subsection{Structure of Numeration Systems}
% Explanation of various numeration systems used historically and in different cultures.
This subsection explores different numeration systems, their historical contexts, and their structures. Understanding these systems helps appreciate the evolution of mathematical thought.


\textbf{Example:} Compare the representation of the year 2024 in Roman numerals and Hindu-Arabic numerals. In Roman numerals, 2024 is written as MMXXIV, which combines symbols for 1000, 10, and 5 minus 1. In Hindu-Arabic numerals, it is written as 2024, showing a sequential and positional use of numbers.

\textbf{Worked Example:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Roman numeral MMXXIV is comprised of two M's (each representing 1000), two X's (each representing 10), and IV (representing 4, as 5 minus 1). Thus, MMXXIV represents 1000 + 1000 + 10 + 10 + (5 - 1) = 2024.
    \item In Hindu-Arabic numerals, the number 2024 is represented positionally, where '2' is in the thousand's place, '0' in the hundred's place, '2' in the ten's place, and '4' in the one's place.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Roles of Place Value and Zero}
% Exploration of the concept of place value and the critical role of zero in modern numeration.
Place value significantly influences the understanding and manipulation of numbers. The role of zero is pivotal as both a placeholder and a numeral.


\textbf{Example:} Illustrate the difference between 406 and 460 to demonstrate place value and the role of zero.


\textbf{Worked Example:}
\begin{itemize}
        \item In 406, the digit 4 is in the hundreds place, 0 in the tens place, and 6 in the ones place, making it four hundred and six.
        \item In 460, the digit 4 is in the hundreds place, 6 in the tens place, and 0 in the ones place, making it four hundred and sixty.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Magnitude of Different Number Types}
% Discussing the relative sizes and scope of different number types like whole numbers, integers, and rational numbers.
Understanding the magnitude of numbers, including whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, is crucial in mathematics.


\textbf{Example:} Use a number line to demonstrate the relative positions and magnitudes of -3, 1/2, and 4.


\textbf{Worked Example:}
\begin{itemize}
        \item On a number line, -3 is located three units to the left of 0, 1/2 is located halfway between 0 and 1, and 4 is located four units to the right of 0.
        \item This placement visually represents that -3 is less than 1/2, and 1/2 is less than 4. The concept of absolute value can further be used to understand that the magnitude of -3 (which is 3) is less than the magnitude of 4.
\end{itemize}

        \item Consider a car traveling at a constant speed of 60 km/h.
        \item The distance traveled \( d \) (in km) in \( t \) hours can be represented by the linear function \( d = 60t \).

        \item The y-intercept \( b \) is -3, meaning the line crosses the y-axis at \( y = -3 \).
        \item Plot the y-intercept and use the slope to find another point (e.g., from \( y = -3 \), move up 2 units and to the right 1 unit to find the point (1, -1)).

\textbf{Worked Example:}
\begin{itemize}
        \item The vertex form of a quadratic equation is \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex.
        \item To find the vertex of \( y = x^2 - 4x + 3 \), complete the square to rewrite it in vertex form.
        \item The completed square form is \( y = (x - 2)^2 - 1 \), so the vertex is \((2, -1)\).

This subsection covers their applications in real-life contexts like population growth and radioactive decay.


\textbf{Example:} Model a population of bacteria that doubles every hour, starting with 100 bacteria.


\textbf{Worked Example:}
\begin{itemize}
        \item The initial amount of bacteria \( a \) is 100.
        \item Since the population doubles every hour, the growth factor \( b \) is 2.
        \item The exponential growth function is \( y = 100 \cdot 2^x \), where \( x \) is time in hours.
        \item After 3 hours, the population would be \( y = 100 \cdot 2^3 = 800 \) bacteria.

\section{Competency 007: Foundations of Calculus}
% Relates middle school topics to calculus concepts.


\subsection{Concept of Limit}
% Introducing the fundamental concept of limits in calculus.
The concept of a limit is a cornerstone in calculus. It describes the behavior of a function as it approaches a certain point. This subsection introduces the basic idea of limits and how they are used to understand the behavior of functions near specific points.


\textbf{Example:} Explain the concept of a limit using a simple function, such as \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \), as \( x \) approaches 0.


\textbf{Worked Example:}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \).
        \item As \( x \) approaches 0 from the positive side, the values of \( f(x) \) become very large. This is observed as the function values increase without bound.
        \item We say that the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 from the positive side is infinity, symbolically written as \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty \).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Average and Instantaneous Rate of Change}
% Discussing the concepts of average and instantaneous rates of change as precursors to derivatives.
The average rate of change of a function over an interval gives the overall rate at which the function changes over that interval. The instantaneous rate of change, on the other hand, is the rate at a specific moment and is a fundamental concept leading to the derivative in calculus.


\textbf{Example:} Calculate the average rate of change of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 4 \).


\textbf{Worked Example:}
\begin{itemize}
        \item The average rate of change of a function \( f(x) \) over an interval \( [a, b] \) is given by \( \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \).
        \item For \( f(x) = x^2 \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 4 \):
        \item Calculate \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \) and \( f(4) = 4^2 = 16 \).
        \item The average rate of change is \( \frac{16 - 1}{4 - 1} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).
        \item This means that, on average, the function increases by 5 units for each unit increase in \( x \) over this interval.
\end{itemize}



\section{Competency 007: Foundations of Calculus}
\subsection{Concept of Limit}
Python can be used to introduce the concept of limits.


\begin{lstlisting}[style=pythonstyle]

% Discusses units of measurement, conversions, and error effects.


\subsection{Units of Measurement}
% Exploring different units used for measurement and their significance.
This subsection introduces various units of measurement used in different systems, such as the Metric system and the Imperial system. It emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate units for specific measurements, such as length, mass, volume, and temperature.


\textbf{Example:} Discuss the appropriate units to measure the length of a classroom.


\textbf{Worked Example:}
\begin{itemize}
        \item In the Metric system, meters (m) or centimeters (cm) are suitable units for measuring the length of a classroom.
        \item If the classroom is approximately 10 meters long, it would be measured as 10 m or 1000 cm.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Conversions and Dimensional Analysis}
% Discussing how to convert between different units and the concept of dimensional analysis.
Conversions between different units within the same system or between systems (like Metric to Imperial) are crucial in various fields. Dimensional analysis is a technique used to convert units and ensure that equations make sense in terms of dimensions (such as length, time, mass).


\textbf{Example:} Convert 5 kilometers to meters.


\textbf{Worked Example:}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Recognize that 1 kilometer (km) equals 1000 meters (m).
        \item Therefore, to convert 5 km to meters, multiply 5 by 1000.
        \item \( 5 \, \text{km} \times 1000 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{km}} = 5000 \, \text{m} \).
        \item So, 5 km is equivalent to 5000 meters.
